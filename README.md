Problem statement - describe the problem that your project is trying to solve <br>
I love travelling, so I would like to create a simple application to record the place I have been to and activities I have done.

Solution statement - describe the solution you implemented to solve the problem <br>
I create a simple web application and use sql as database to store the information.

User - describe the typical user(s) that would use your solution <br>
People who also enjoy travelling like myself.

Domain objects - describe at least two of the domain objects you implemented in your solution <br>
trip: represent a whole trip. Some users may share one trip so one trip can link to multiple users. <br>
