# CS3200 Final Project
Problem statement <br>
I love travelling, so I would like to create a simple application to record the place I have been to and activities I have done.

Solution statement <br>
I create a simple web application and use sql as database to store the information.

User <br>
People who also enjoy travelling like myself.

Domain objects <br>
trip: represent a whole trip. Some users may share one trip so one trip can link to multiple users. <br>
destination: represent the important location where activities happen during the trip. Multiple destinations link to one trip. <br>
